# map-editor

A simple map editor developed in Java, similar to MS Paint, using Simple GFX Library. <br><br>
This was an exercise given at week 5 of the <Academia de CÃ³digo_> bootcamp to apply basic Java I/O and newly learned skills to read and write from a file using a BufferedReader and Writer. <br><br>
The idea was to create a grid that could be painted, erased, saved or loaded. As an additional feature, i was able to implement colour selection on the paint action. <br><br>
If you want to explore, use the arrows to navigate the cells. Space key will color a cell or uncolor. S key will save current drawing. C key will clear current drawing. L key will load previously saved drawing. N key will change color. <br><br>
Have fun!
